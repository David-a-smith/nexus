Sensors
=======

Sensors listen for events happening that DD may be interested in. When they
detect an event of interest, they raise an event and publish it into the Nexus
sensor stream. Zero or more executors may decide to execute a flow based on the
information received in the sensor.

While being completely decoupled in the codebase, sensors must share a common
schema with the executors that consume their messages. This allows executors
to validate the structure of the message they have received. Additionally, it
allows the Nexus UI to dynamically construct UI input/output components between
sensors and executors.
